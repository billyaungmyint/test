# Regression Test Suite for [Project Name]

## Overview

This document describes the regression test suite for the [Project Name] project. Its primary goal is to ensure the continued stability, correctness, and reliability of [Project Name] by systematically testing its features and functionalities.

*   **Purpose:** To automatically verify that new code changes do not break existing functionality (i.e., cause regressions) and that the software behaves as expected across a wide range of inputs and scenarios. This suite is crucial for maintaining software quality and enabling confident refactoring and development.
*   **Testing Framework:** This suite primarily uses `pytest` for test discovery, execution, and assertion.
*   **Random Data Generation:** For comprehensive testing of various input domains, this suite leverages `Hypothesis`. Hypothesis is a property-based testing library that generates diverse and often surprising examples based on defined data strategies.
*   **Other Key Libraries:** [Project Specific: List any other key testing libraries, e.g., "Requests for API interaction testing", "Selenium for UI testing", "Mock for creating test doubles"].

## How it Works (The Role of Random Data)

This test suite employs random data generation, particularly through property-based testing with Hypothesis, to thoroughly exercise the functionality of [Project Name].

*   **Approach:** Instead of relying solely on manually crafted, example-based tests (e.g., "test with input X, expect output Y"), we define properties that should hold true for a wide range of inputs. For example, "for any valid user input string `s`, `process_string(s)` should not raise an unhandled exception." Hypothesis then generates many varied strings to test this property.
*   **Domain of Data Generation:**
    *   Data generation is guided by "strategies" defined in the test code. These strategies specify the type, constraints, and structure of the data to be generated.
    *   Examples:
        *   For user input validation: Strategies might generate strings of varying lengths, character sets (including Unicode and special characters), numbers within and outside expected ranges, and different data types.
        *   For API endpoint testing: Strategies can create complex JSON payloads with optional fields present or absent, values at boundary conditions, and malformed structures to test error handling.
        *   [Project Specific: Add 1-2 more examples relevant to the project, e.g., "For date processing functions, strategies generate datetime objects spanning different years, including leap years and timezone-aware dates."]
    *   Hypothesis is intelligent about exploring the defined domain, often finding edge cases that humans might miss. It also "shrinks" failing test cases to the simplest possible example that still causes the failure, making debugging much easier.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Broader Coverage:** Random data generation allows testing a significantly larger portion of the input space than manual example-based testing alone.
    *   **Edge Case Discovery:** Automated generation is excellent at finding unexpected edge cases and inputs that can trigger bugs.
    *   **Reduced Bias:** It helps avoid the natural bias developers might have when writing tests based on their own understanding of the code.
    *   **Maintainability:** Property-based tests can often be more concise and easier to maintain than numerous individual example tests, as they describe general behavior.

## Prerequisites & Setup

To run this test suite, you'll need the following:

*   **Python Version:** [Project Specific: e.g., "Python 3.8+"]
*   **Dependencies:** All necessary Python packages are listed in `requirements-test.txt` (or `pyproject.toml`'s development dependencies section).
*   **Environment:** It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment (e.g., `venv`, `conda`, `poetry`, `pdm`) to isolate dependencies and ensure a consistent testing environment.
*   **Installation Steps:**
    1.  Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
        ```bash
        git clone [Project Specific: repository_url]
        cd [Project Specific: repository_directory]
        ```
    2.  Create and activate a virtual environment (example using `venv`):
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    3.  Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements-test.txt
        # Or if using Poetry:
        # poetry install --with dev
        # Or if using PDM:
        # pdm install -G test
        ```
    4.  [Project Specific: Add any other crucial setup steps, e.g., "Set the `API_KEY` environment variable as described in `config.example.env`", "Ensure a local PostgreSQL instance is running and configured as per `database_setup.md`."]

## Running the Tests

To execute the entire test suite, navigate to the root of the project directory in your terminal (where the `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` file is located) and run:

```bash
pytest
```

*   **Common Options:**
    *   **Verbose Output:** For more detailed output on which tests are running:
        ```bash
        pytest -v
        ```
    *   **Run Specific Files or Directories:**
        ```bash
        pytest tests/specific_module/test_feature.py
        pytest tests/another_module/
        ```
    *   **Run Tests by Keyword Expression:** Pytest will run tests whose names match the expression:
        ```bash
        pytest -k "user_authentication or login"
        ```
    *   **Run Tests by Markers:** If tests are decorated with markers (e.g., `@pytest.mark.slow`):
        ```bash
        pytest -m slow  # Run tests marked as 'slow'
        pytest -m "not slow" # Run tests not marked as 'slow'
        ```
    *   **Stop on First Failure:** To stop the test session immediately after the first failing test:
        ```bash
        pytest -x
        ```
    *   **Show `print()` Statements:** To see output from `print()` statements in your tests (useful for debugging):
        ```bash
        pytest -s
        ```
*   [Project Specific: Add any project-specific commands or configurations for running tests, e.g., "To run tests against a staging environment, use: `pytest --env staging`"]

## Interpreting Test Results & Reproducing Failures

*   **Pass/Fail Indicators:**
    *   `.`: Test passed.
    *   `F`: Test failed (an `AssertionError` was raised).
    *   `E`: Test resulted in an unexpected error (an exception other than `AssertionError`).
    *   `s`: Test was skipped (usually via `@pytest.mark.skip` or `pytest.skip()`).
    *   `x`: Test was expected to fail but passed (marked with `@pytest.mark.xfail`).
    *   `X`: Test was expected to fail and did fail (marked with `@pytest.mark.xfail`).
    A summary at the end of the test run will show the counts for each status.

*   **Hypothesis Test Failures & Database:**
    *   When a test using Hypothesis fails, Hypothesis saves the minimal input that caused the failure to a local database (typically located at `.hypothesis/examples/` in your project root).
    *   The next time you run the *same test function*, Hypothesis will first try these saved failing examples before generating new ones. This ensures that a previously found bug is consistently re-checked.
    *   **Important:** This local database is generally not checked into version control. To ensure a specific failing example is permanently tested by everyone and in CI, it should be added explicitly to the test code (see below).

*   **Reproducing Failures from CI/Logs (Hypothesis):**
    *   If a Hypothesis-driven test fails in a CI build or you have logs from a failure, Hypothesis often prints a line that looks like this:
        ```
        Falsifying example: test_my_function(arg1=..., arg2=...)
        You can reproduce this failure by adding @reproduce_failure('X.Y.Z', b'some_base64_encoded_blob==') to your test function.
        ```
        (The exact version and blob will vary).
    *   **To reproduce this specific failure locally:**
        1.  Copy the entire `@reproduce_failure(...)` decorator line.
        2.  In your local source code, find the test function mentioned (e.g., `test_my_function`).
        3.  Paste the copied decorator directly above the `def test_my_function(...):` line.
        4.  Re-run `pytest`, targeting this specific test if desired. Hypothesis will then attempt to reproduce that exact failing scenario using the provided blob.
    *   Once the failure is reproduced and understood, it's good practice to remove the `@reproduce_failure` decorator and, if the failing input represents an important edge case, add it as a permanent `@example(...)` (see "Adding New Tests").

*   **General Failures (Non-Hypothesis):** For tests that don't use Hypothesis, the pytest output will provide a traceback indicating the file, line number, and assertion that failed, or the point where an unhandled exception occurred.

## Debugging Failing Tests

When a test fails, here are some approaches to debug it:

*   **Understand the Failure:** Carefully read the pytest output. For assertion failures, it will show the differing values. For exceptions, it will show the traceback.
*   **Hypothesis `note()` function:** If the failing test uses Hypothesis, you can add `note()` calls within your test function to log the state of variables or intermediate computations. This information is then printed by Hypothesis when it reports the failing example.
    ```python
    from hypothesis import note, given, strategies as st

    @given(st.integers(), st.integers())
    def test_something(x, y):
        intermediate_result = x + y
        note(f"Intermediate result was: {intermediate_result}")
        assert intermediate_result % 2 == 0 # Example assertion
    ```
*   **Standard Python Debugging (`pdb`):**
    *   You can run pytest with the `--pdb` flag, which will automatically drop you into the Python debugger (`pdb`) at the point of failure:
        ```bash
        pytest --pdb
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can insert `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` directly into your test code (or the application code) at the line where you want to start debugging. Then run the test normally.
*   **Print Statements:** Good old `print()` statements can be helpful. Remember to run pytest with the `-s` flag to see their output:
    ```bash
    pytest -s
    ```
*   **IDE Debugger:** Most Python IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.) have excellent built-in debuggers. You can typically set breakpoints in your test code or the application code and run the tests in debug mode from the IDE.
*   **Simplify the Case:** If a complex, randomly generated input causes a failure, try to manually simplify it to the smallest possible input that still triggers the bug. Hypothesis does this automatically ("shrinking"), but sometimes further manual simplification can aid understanding.

## Adding New Tests / Modifying Existing Ones

Contributions to improve test coverage are highly welcome!

*   **Test File Location:** [Project Specific: e.g., "Generally, test files should mirror the structure of the application code under `src/`. For example, tests for `src/mymodule/feature.py` might go into `tests/mymodule/test_feature.py`."]
*   **Test Naming Conventions:**
    *   Test files should be named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`.
    *   Test functions should be prefixed with `test_` (e.g., `def test_user_can_login():`).
    *   Test classes (if used) should be prefixed with `Test` (e.g., `class TestUserAuthentication:`).
*   **Writing Property-Based Tests (with Hypothesis):**
    *   **Identify Properties:** Think about the invariants or contracts of your code. What should always be true for any valid input?
    *   **Define Strategies:** Use Hypothesis's `strategies` module (`import hypothesis.strategies as st`) to define how to generate data for your test function's arguments.
        *   Start with basic strategies (e.g., `st.integers()`, `st.text()`, `st.booleans()`).
        *   Combine and transform them (e.g., `st.lists(st.integers())`, `st.dictionaries(...)`, `st.builds(MyClass, ...)`).
        *   Use `st.composite()` for more complex, custom data generation logic.
        *   Filter data using `.filter()` or `assume()` within the test if certain generated values are invalid for the specific property being tested (but prefer to make strategies generate valid data directly if possible).
    *   **Use `@given(...)`:** Decorate your test function with `@given(...)`, passing the strategies for its arguments.
    *   Refer to the [Hypothesis documentation](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for comprehensive guidance.
*   **Adding Explicit Examples (Hypothesis):** If you find a specific input (perhaps from a bug report or a `@reproduce_failure` scenario) that is critical to test explicitly, add it using the `@example(...)` decorator above `@given(...)`.
    ```python
    from hypothesis import given, example, strategies as st

    @example(value=-1) # Ensure this specific edge case is always tested
    @given(st.integers(min_value=0))
    def test_positive_or_zero(value):
        assert value >= 0
    ```
*   **Fixtures for Setup/Teardown:** Use pytest fixtures for setting up preconditions for tests and for cleaning up resources afterwards.
*   **Assertions:** Use standard `assert` statements. Pytest provides detailed information on assertion failures.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** Write tests that are easy to understand. Use clear variable names and keep tests focused on a single piece of functionality or property.
*   [Project Specific: Add any project-specific style guides or testing patterns to follow.]

## Key Properties Being Tested

This section aims to provide an overview of the core functionalities and invariants verified by this test suite. It is not exhaustive but highlights key areas.

*   **[Project Specific: Property Area 1, e.g., User Authentication & Authorization]**
    *   Description: [e.g., "Verifies that users can register, log in with valid credentials, are denied access with invalid credentials, session management works correctly, and role-based access controls are enforced."]
    *   Key Strategies/Inputs: [e.g., "Generates valid and invalid email formats, password strings of varying complexity and length, mock user roles."]
    *   Relevant Test Modules: [e.g., `tests/auth/`, `tests/api/test_user_endpoints.py`]
*   **[Project Specific: Property Area 2, e.g., Core Business Logic for Feature X]**
    *   Description: [e.g., "Tests the core calculations and state transitions involved in Feature X, ensuring accuracy, idempotency where applicable, and correct handling of boundary conditions."]
    *   Key Strategies/Inputs: [e.g., "Strategies for generating valid and invalid [DataModelForFeatureX] objects, sequences of operations, varying numerical inputs."]
    *   Relevant Test Modules: [e.g., `tests/feature_x/test_calculations.py`, `tests/feature_x/test_state_changes.py`]
*   **[Project Specific: Property Area 3, e.g., API Endpoint Y - Data Integrity]**
    *   Description: [e.g., "Ensures that API Endpoint Y correctly validates input data, stores it without corruption, and that data retrieved matches what was stored. Checks for race conditions in concurrent writes if applicable."]
    *   Key Strategies/Inputs: [e.g., "Generates diverse valid and malformed JSON payloads for Endpoint Y, explores different HTTP methods, and simulates concurrent requests."]
    *   Relevant Test Modules: [e.g., `tests/api/test_endpoint_y.py`]
*   **[TODO: This section should be actively maintained and updated as the test suite evolves to reflect the actual coverage and intent of the tests.]**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Issue:** Tests involving date/time are flaky or fail in CI but not locally.
    *   **Possible Cause & Solution:** Timezone differences between environments, or tests that implicitly rely on `datetime.now()` without appropriate mocking or control. Use libraries like `freezegun` to control time in tests, or ensure all datetime operations are timezone-aware and normalized.
*   **Issue:** Hypothesis tests are too slow or report health check errors.
    *   **Possible Cause & Solution:**
        *   Strategies might be too broad (e.g., `st.text()` without constraints can generate huge strings). Narrow the domain of your strategies (e.g., `st.text(max_size=...)`, `st.integers(min_value=..., max_value=...)`).
        *   Overuse of `assume()` or `.filter()` can lead to Hypothesis rejecting too many examples. Try to define strategies that directly generate valid data for the property being tested.
        *   Review Hypothesis's health check messages for specific advice. You might need to adjust settings like `max_examples` or `deadline` for specific tests using `@settings(...)`, but do this judiciously.
*   **Issue:** "Database already contains an example that falsifies test..."
    *   **Possible Cause & Solution:** This means Hypothesis has previously found and saved a failing example for this test. If you've fixed the bug, you might want to clear the Hypothesis database for that test. You can do this by deleting the specific file in the `.hypothesis/examples/` directory corresponding to the test, or by deleting the entire `.hypothesis` directory (it will be recreated). However, ensure the bug is actually fixed first!
